# Product Review Classification using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to classify product reviews as positive or negative using machine learning algorithms. We will employ text vectorization methods such as Bag of Words (BOW), TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and TF-IDF Weighted Word2Vec to represent text data, and then use the K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for classification.

## Data
The data used in this project is a collection of product reviews collected from online shopping websites. The data includes the review text and ratings based on user sentiment.

## Installation
1. Install Python (version 3.x).
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the `Classification_Project.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to see the data preprocessing, vectorization, and classification workflow.
2. To test the model on new data, simply change the input data in the notebook or write similar code with new data.

## Project Structure
- `Classification_Project.ipynb`: Notebook containing source code for data preprocessing, vectorization, and classification.
- `data/`: Directory containing input data.
- `README.md`: Usage guide documentation (you're reading it).

## Technology Used
